# web-dev-resources
This repository will be a collection of links to learn while following the [frontend-roadmap-path](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
For the complete roadmap please check the link provided above or the image ad the end of this README.
I would like to quote the podcast [Start Here: Web Development](https://open.spotify.com/show/3V8TSvhtTRohclApkh2xIu?si=F_NKxydHQJ6VtmKJV_ZmyQ&dl_branch=1):
"We don't believe you need to pay for an education in web development so bypass those resources."
Happy learning!
